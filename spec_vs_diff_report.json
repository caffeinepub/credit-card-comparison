  "summary": "The diff implements all four major requirements with a Motoko backend storing credit card data and a React frontend providing listing, filtering, sorting, comparison, and theming. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed. No significant missing requirements or hallucinated features were found.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "getSortedCards backend query exposed and called from frontend for server-side sorting",
      "reason": "The build request specifies sorting as a frontend UI control (REQ-2 mentions sorting options in the UI), and does not explicitly require a backend sorting endpoint. The diff adds a getSortedCards call to the backend and a corresponding backend function, which goes beyond what was requested as sorting could have been done purely in frontend state.",

    {
      "description": "ComparisonBar renders and shows card chips even when only 1 card is selected",
      "reason": "REQ-3 specifies the sticky bar should appear when at least 2 cards are selected, but the ComparisonBar component renders when selectedCards.length >= 1 based on the guard condition of returning null only when length < 1.",
